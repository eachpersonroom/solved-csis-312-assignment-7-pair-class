Write a generic class Pair which has two type parameters—F and S—each representing the type of the first and second element of the pair, respectively. Add set and get methods for the first and second elements of the pair. (Hint: The class header should be public class Pair&lt;f, s=”” style=”box-sizing: inherit;”.)



Write a separate PairTest class to test class Pair. Create 2 Pair types and test your get and set methods on the following pair types:

Pair&lt;integer, string=”” style=”box-sizing: inherit;” p1 takes Integer and String types as a pairPair&lt;string, integer=”” style=”box-sizing: inherit;” p2 takes String and IntegerPairTest should output enough information to the terminal to show that your generic class Pair is able to set() and get() different types.
